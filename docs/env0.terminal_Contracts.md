# Baseline Reset (December 2025)

This file contains historical contract material from prior milestones. It is preserved for context.

True north for the new baseline:
- Public API may change; we are not constrained by prior Unity integration.
- The engine remains headless and deterministic, with a single coordination entrypoint.
- JSON-driven world state remains the default configuration source.
- Tests define the current contract; update tests and docs together.

# env0.terminal – Canonical Component Map (Source/Config Only)

> **Project Status: 2025-05-25**
>
> - **Milestone 1A (Terminal Core): COMPLETE**
> - **Milestone 1B (Network, SSH, Devices, JSON): COMPLETE**
> - All contract tests pass. Hostile/psychotic edge-case tests are commented and justified; non-contract failures do not block milestone.
> - All components listed below are implemented unless otherwise noted.
> - **Filesystem loading, conversion, and debug output are fully routed through DebugUtility (no Console.WriteLine in loader/core logic).**
> - **SSH login is robust: supports 'abort', blocks cyclic/self-SSH, and preserves session stack integrity.**

## Psychotic/Hostile Test Policy

- **Test Philosophy:**  
  All critical, canonical, and plausible hostile edge cases are covered by the contract test suite.  
  *“Psychotic”* edge-case tests—those requiring code injection, abusive input, or extreme user behavior (not covered by contract/narrative requirements)—are:
  - **Commented out** in the test suite,
  - **Retained for reference** (never deleted),
  - **Explicitly annotated** with rationale explaining why they are out-of-scope or unsupported.
- **Milestone Completion:**  
  Hostile/psychotic test failures only block a milestone if they expose a contract or canonical behavior failure.  
  Out-of-scope or “not a bug” test failures are preserved but do **not** block milestone status.
- **Preservation, not deletion:**  
  The test suite remains auditable—*all edge/hostile cases are documented for future reference or expansion*.

## Core Contract Sections

### CommandHandler.cs — Contract

**Purpose:**  
Central dispatcher for all user commands. Receives parsed command name and arguments, plus the current session state/context. Finds and executes the appropriate ICommand implementation. Never directly implements command logic.

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintains a registry/dictionary of all available commands (`ls`, `cd`, `cat`, etc.), mapping command names/aliases to ICommand implementations.
- Checks if the command exists and is enabled (including debug flag for debug-only commands).
- Passes session state/context and argument array to the command’s `Execute()` method.
- Returns the command’s result (including output, error, or session state changes) to TerminalStateManager or caller.
- Handles unrecognized commands with a canonical error message (`bash: [cmd]: command not found`).

**NOT Responsible For:**
- Parsing input (handled by CommandParser).
- Maintaining session state (TerminalStateManager does this).
- Printing or outputting directly (returns results to caller).
- Error catching inside command implementations (each command must handle its own errors and report as part of result).
- Auto-discovering commands (registration is explicit).

**Uses:**
- `ICommand` interface (implemented by all command modules)
- Receives parsed command name/args from CommandParser
- Receives session state from TerminalStateManager

**Used By:**
- TerminalStateManager (calls to execute commands)
- Playground/CLI test harness

**Completion:** ✅ Implemented

**Cross-Reference:**
- REFERENCE.md § Command System
- Q&A § CommandHandler Modularity, Error Handling, Registration

---

### ICommand (Interface) — Contract

**Purpose:**  
Defines the contract for all command modules (including core, debug, and future commands).

**Responsibilities:**
- Exposes an `Execute(SessionState state, string[] args)` method (or similar).
- Handles all logic for the command, including argument validation, session checks, and error handling.
- Returns a standardized CommandResult (output string, error, state change flag, etc.).

**Completion:** ✅ Implemented

**Cross-Reference:**
- REFERENCE.md § Command System
- Q&A § Command Modularity/Debug

---

### TerminalStateManager.cs — Contract

**Purpose:**  
Orchestrates all session state, transitions (boot → username assign → shell → SSH), prompt construction, and stack management. Owns the current session object (user, device, cwd, SSH stack, debug flag, etc). Acts as “the brain” that calls CommandHandler and applies results.

**Responsibilities:**
- Owns and updates all session state: username, current device, working directory, SSH stack, debug flag, command history.
- Manages state transitions per REFERENCE.md state diagram (including stack overflow/underflow logic for SSH).
- Builds and returns the dynamic prompt string based on session state (username, hostname, cwd) after any state transition or command.
- Applies changes/results from CommandHandler (filesystem, device, cwd changes, etc).
- Suppresses prompt at boot/username/SSH login.
- Returns all output for display; does not directly print or render.

**NOT Responsible For:**
- Parsing/handling user commands (calls CommandHandler for that).
- Implementing command logic.
- Storing or parsing JSON config (uses managers/loaders).
- Handling direct input/output (only returns output for display layer).

**Uses:**
- CommandHandler (to run commands)
- FilesystemManager, LoginHandler, SSHHandler, NetworkManager (to enact state changes)
- Session state object

**Used By:**
- Playground/CLI harness
- (Future) Unity/Front-end consumer

**Completion:** ✅ Implemented

**Cross-Reference:**
- REFERENCE.md § State Machine, Session State, Prompt Construction
- Q&A § State transitions, stack handling, prompt rules

---

### DebugManager.cs — Contract

**Purpose:**  
Provides all debug/dev-only features, toggles, and info for the logic engine. Controls whether debug mode is active, exposes debug-only commands, and manages debug output sections. Keeps all debug logic isolated from core session/command logic.

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintains the global debug flag (on/off).
- Handles the `debug` command to toggle debug mode (can only be run in dev/test builds).
- Registers and manages debug-only commands (e.g., `show filesystems`, `list devices`, `teleport`, `clear debug`), ensuring they are only enabled when debug mode is active.
- Aggregates and returns all debug output sections (e.g., JSON validation errors, session info, internal state) as separate output blocks for the front-end or test harness.
- Ensures all debug output is visually distinct (e.g., bright yellow, [DEBUG] tag in returned strings).
- Allows commands and managers to log debug messages or errors (internal API), but does not process or render them—simply collects and exposes for output.
- Provides methods for other managers/components to check whether debug mode is currently active.
- **All loader/conversion debug output is routed via DebugUtility, never Console.WriteLine.**

**NOT Responsible For:**
- Storing session state (TerminalStateManager does this).
- Running or parsing user commands (CommandHandler does this; DebugManager only exposes debug commands for registration).
- Outputting or rendering text (just returns debug info to caller).
- Validating or mutating normal user-facing state.

**Uses:**
- None directly (holds its own debug command registry and debug state flag).
- May be called by CommandHandler, TerminalStateManager, FilesystemManager, JsonLoader, etc. to check if debug is active, or to log debug info.

**Used By:**
- CommandHandler (to register/enable debug-only commands)
- TerminalStateManager (to include debug output sections)
- All core managers (to log internal debug messages or errors)
- Playground/CLI/test harness (to display debug output)
- (Future) Unity or front-end layer for dev mode UI

**Completion:** 🚧 (Not implemented)

**Cross-Reference:**
- REFERENCE.md § Debug Mode
- Q&A § Debug/dev commands, error output, debug flag handling

---

### SessionState.cs — Contract

**Purpose:**  
Stores all mutable session data: username, password (flavor), current device, current working directory, command history, SSH stack (list of session contexts), debug flag, etc.

**Responsibilities:**
- Provides structured access to all user/session state variables.
- Passed to commands, managers, handlers as needed.
- Resettable (new instance on session restart/reset).

**NOT Responsible For:**
- Business logic, command parsing, state transitions.
- Exposing public methods (pure data object).

**Used By:**
- TerminalStateManager, CommandHandler, SSHHandler, all ICommand classes, Playground/CLI.

**Completion:** ✅ Implemented

**Cross-Reference:**
- REFERENCE.md § Session State, Prompt Construction, SSH Stack

---

### CommandResult.cs — Contract

**Purpose:**  
Standard return type for all commands. Encapsulates command output, error messages, paging flags, session state changes, or other results.

**Responsibilities:**
- Standardizes the way commands return output/error for display/logging.
- Encapsulates all data needed by the caller (including, if needed, a new SessionState).

**NOT Responsible For:**
- Business logic or state mutation; just a container for results.

**Used By:**
- ICommand classes, CommandHandler, TerminalStateManager, Playground/CLI.

**Completion:** ✅ Implemented

**Cross-Reference:**
- REFERENCE.md § Command System, Error Handling, Output

---

### TerminalEngineAPI.cs — Contract

**Purpose:**  
Defines the public interface for the env0.terminal logic engine, for front-end (Unity), Playground, or any CLI/test harness.

**Responsibilities:**
- Exposes all core functionality as public methods/events (e.g., `SendInput(string command)`, `GetPrompt()`, `GetOutput()`, `GetSessionState()`, etc.).
- Provides a stable entry point for initialization, session reset, and integration.
- Hides internal implementation details and private state from the front-end.

## TerminalEngineAPI – Public Contract

This contract defines the public API surface for `TerminalEngineAPI.cs`, the single entry point for all external interaction with the terminal simulation engine.  
All front-end (Unity, CLI, test harnesses, etc.) must use this API for all terminal operations.

---

### **Phases**

```csharp
public enum TerminalPhase
{
    Booting,
    Login,
    Terminal
}
```

---

### **Render State**

```csharp
public class TerminalRenderState
{
    public TerminalPhase Phase { get; set; }

    // Boot phase
    public List<string> BootSequenceLines { get; set; }

    // Login phase
    public bool IsLoginPrompt { get; set; }
    public bool IsPasswordPrompt { get; set; }
    public string LoginErrorMessage { get; set; }

    // Terminal phase
    public string Prompt { get; set; }                 // e.g., user@host:/cwd$
    public string Output { get; set; }                 // Last command result
    public string CurrentDirectory { get; set; }
    public List<string> DirectoryListing { get; set; } // Result of 'ls' or for UI
    public int SessionStackDepth { get; set; }
    public List<SessionContext> SessionStackView { get; set; }
    public bool ClearScreen { get; set; }
    public bool IsError { get; set; }
    public string ErrorMessage { get; set; }

    // MOTD / narrative banners
    public bool ShowMOTD { get; set; }
    public string MOTD { get; set; }

    // Debug/dev mode
    public bool DebugMode { get; set; }
    public DebugInfo DebugInfo { get; set; } // Only set if DebugMode=true

    // Any additional narrative/special state flags as needed
}
```

---

### **Session Context**

```csharp
public class SessionContext
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Hostname { get; set; }
    public string Prompt { get; set; }
}
```

---

### **Public API Methods**

```csharp
public class TerminalEngineAPI
{
    // Initialize all configs as raw JSON strings
    public void Initialize(string bootConfigJson, string userConfigJson, string deviceConfigJson, string filesystemJson);

    // Accept a user input line (command), returns updated render state
    public TerminalRenderState Execute(string input);

    // Reset the session to start state
    public void Reset();

    // Toggle debug mode (optional, for dev/testing)
    public void SetDebugMode(bool enabled);
}
```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- All output and state needed for UI is exposed via `TerminalRenderState`.
- No UI, rendering, or input validation logic is performed here—**logic only**.
- Special states (boot, login, SSH stack, banners, errors, etc.) are always signaled with flags; front-end never infers state by parsing output.
- Debug info is only returned if debug mode is enabled.
- No direct access to filesystem, session internals, or AAI/narrative systems.

---

**This contract is canonical. Any future fields/methods should be added only as narrative/UI/gameplay needs dictate.**

**NOT Responsible For:**
- Implementing core logic (delegates to underlying managers/handlers).
- UI, audio, rendering, or direct user I/O.

**Used By:**
- Unity front-end, Playground, test suites.

**Completion:** 🚧 (Not implemented)

**Cross-Reference:**
- REFERENCE.md § Integration, Session State, Input/Output, Playground

---

## Milestone Completion Notes

- **Filesystem loading, conversion, and debug output are fully standardized via DebugUtility. No Console.WriteLine is present in loader/core logic.**
- **SSH login is robust: supports 'abort', blocks cyclic/self-SSH, and maintains full session stack integrity.**
- All logic is milestone-complete, fully aligned with REFERENCE.md and all contracts.
